method takes a string s as input and splits it into separate words using the split method. It then uses the map method to iterate over each word in the array and capitalize the first letter of each word, except for the first word, which is left unchanged. Finally, it joins the words together using the join method. The with_index method is used to access the index of each word in the array, which is needed to determine whether or not to capitalize the first letter.
