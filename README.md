we add the camelCase method to the String.prototype object by assigning it to a new function that takes no arguments. The function then splits the input string into an array of words using the split method, loops over each word and capitalizes the first letter using the charAt and toUpperCase methods, and finally joins the words back together without spaces using the join method.

Note that by adding this method to the String.prototype object, we can now call the camelCase method on any string value in our code.
